  ================================================ 
   YOU ARE GOOD
   ============

   VERSE 1
   -------
   D             D/C#  G
   Lord let Your glory fall,
   D/F#          G
   As on that ancient day
   Bm7         D/F#   G
   Songs of enduring love,
   Em7            G     D
   And then Your glory came
   D         D/C#    G
   And as a sign to You,
   D/F#           G
   That we would love the same,
   Bm7            D/F#        G
   Our hearts will sing that song,
   Em7            G     D
   God, let Your glory come
    
   CHORUS
   ------
           D/F#
   You are good, You are good,
            G
   And Your love endures
           D/F#
   You are good, You are good,
            G
   And Your love endures
           Bm7           D/F#
   You are good, You are good,
            G            D     G
   And Your love endures today
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Voices in unison,
   Giving You thanks and praise
   Joined by the instruments,
   And then Your glory came
   Your presence like a cloud,
   Upon that ancient day,
   The priests were overwhelmed,
   Because Your glory came
    
   VERSE 3
   -------
   A sacrifice was made,
   And then Your fire came,
   They knelt upon the ground,
   And with one voice they praised
