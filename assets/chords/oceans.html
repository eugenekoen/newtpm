    You call me out upon the waters

  The great unknown where feet may fail
  Em                     D/F#   G
    And there I find you in the mystery
        D                   C
  In oceans deep, my faith will stand

    And I will call upon Your name
  C             G           D
    And keep my eyes above the waves
              C                 G             D
  When oceans rise my soul will rest in Your embrace

  For I am Yours and You are mine

  Your sovereign hand will be my guide
  Em                        D/F#    G
    Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me
            D                         C
  You’ve never failed and You won’t start now
