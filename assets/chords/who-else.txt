   VERSE 1
   -------
           G             D
   I am an instrument of exaltation
             Em                D             C
   And I was born to lift the name above all names
                G        D
   You hear the melody of all creation   
                 Em             
   But there's a song of praise 
        D         C
   that only I can bring
    
   CHORUS
   ------
                   G
   Who else is worthy?
                   Am
   Who else is worthy?
             Em                C
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
                   G
   Who else is worthy?
                   Am
   Who else is worthy?
             Em                C
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
               G
   You are the infinite
              D
   God of the ages
           Em               D    
   Yet You chose to make my heart 
                 C
   Your dwelling place
                 G
   You healed my brokenness,
                  D
   Showed me Your glory
             Em                 
   So I have songs of thanks not 
    D          C
   even angels sing
