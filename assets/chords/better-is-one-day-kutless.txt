       G
   How lovely is Your dwelling place
   C           D
   Oh Lord, Almighty
       G
   My soul doth long
                      D
   And even faints for You...
       G
   For here my heart is satisfied
   C            D
   Within your presence
     G                                D
   I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
    
   CHORUS

             C
   Better is one day in Your courts
             D
   Better is one day in Your house
             C
   Better is one day in Your courts
                  D
   Than thousands elsewhere

             C
   Better is one day in Your courts
             D
   Better is one day in Your house
             C
   Better is one day in Your courts
                  D          G
   Than thousands elsewhere

   Em
   My heart and flesh cry out
   D  C
   For You the Living God
   D  Em          D           C
   Your Spirit's water to my soul
   D  Em
   I've tasted and I've seen
   D  C
   Come once again to me
   D  Em        D        C
   I will draw near to you
   D  Em        D       C     D
   I will draw near to You
