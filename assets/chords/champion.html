  CHAMPION
  ========

  VERSE 1
  ------- 
  A
     I've tried so hard to see it   
  D             F#m
     Took me so long to believe it
  A
     That you choose someone like me
  Bm
     To carry your victory
  A
     Perfection could never earn it
  D                   F#m
     You give what we don't deserve it
  A
     And you take the broken things
  Bm
     And raise them to glory
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  A                E
    You are my Champion 
  F#m                  E
  Giants fall when you stand
      D
  Undefeated
        F#m           E
  Every battle you've won
  A                    E
    I am who you say I am
  F#m                       E
    You crown me with confidence
       D             F#m      E
  I am seated in the heavenly place
      D
  Undefeated
           F#m         E            D
  With the one who has conquered it all
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  A
     Now I can finally see it
  F#m
     You're teaching me how to receive it
  E                 A        E
     So let all the striving cease
  Bm
     This is my victory
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  D                 E         F#m
     When I lift my voice and shout
                   E        A
  Every wall comes crashing down
             A
  I have the authority
  E
  Jesus has given me
  D              E     F#m
     When I open up my mouth
                 E        A
  Miracles start breaking out
             A
  I have the authority
  E
  Jesus has given me
