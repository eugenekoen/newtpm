 THIS IS AMAZING GRACE

 INTRO

 G   C   G   C 

 VERSE 1
 -------
 G
 Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
 C
 Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
 Em          D               C
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
 G
 Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
 C
 Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
 Em          D               C
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
 
 CHORUS
 ------
                     G
 This is amazing grace
                     C
 This is unfailing love
                             Em
 That You would take my place
                             D
 That You would bear my cross
                             G
 You would lay down Your life
                         C
 That I would be set free
 Em
 Jesus, I sing for
 D                       G
 All that You've done for me
 
 VERSE 2
 -------
 G
 Who brings our chaos back into order
 C
 Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
 Em          D                     C
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
 G
 Who rules the nations with truth and justice
 C
 Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
 Em          D                     C
 The King of Glory, the King above all kings
 
 BRIDGE
 ------
 G
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
 C
 Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
 Em
 Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
 C
 Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
