  ================================================
  YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
  ================
  
  The whole song we play these 4 chords below
  ==============
  D   G   Bm   A
  ==============

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I see Your face in every sunrise
  The colors of the morning are inside Your eyes
  The world awakens in the light of the day
  I look up to the sky and say 
  You're beautiful
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I see Your power in the moonlit night
  Where planets are in motion and
  the galaxies are bright
  We are amazed in the light of the stars
  It's all proclaiming who you are 
  You're beautiful
   
  VERSE 3
  -------
  I see you there hanging on a tree
  You bled and then you died and then you
  rose again for me
  Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne
  Soon we will be coming home 
  You're beautiful
   
  VERSE 4
  -------
  When we arrive at eternity's shore
  Where death is just a memory and
  tears are no more
  We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring
  Your bride will come together and we'll sing 
  You're beautiful
