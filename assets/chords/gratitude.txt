  GRATITUDE
  ==========================
  VERSE 1
  -------
         G
  All my words fall short
         Em
  I got nothing new
            D
  How could I express
        C
  All my gratitude?
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
          G
  I could sing these songs
       Em
  As I often do
            D
  But every song must end
         C
  And You never do
   
  CHORUS
  ------
       G                                            D
  So I throw up my hands and praise You again and again
   
  'Cause all that I have is a
  C            Em   D
  Hallelujah   Hallelujah

        G                                                  D
  And I know it's not much but I've nothing else fit for a King
   
  Except for a heart singing
  C           Em   D  G
  Hallelujah  Hallelujah
   
  VERSE 3
  -------
           G
  I've got one response
           Em
  I've got just one move
          D
  With my arm stretched wide
        C
  I will worship You   
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
     G
  So come on, my soul
   
  Oh, don't you get shy on me
  D
  Lift up your song
                             C
  'Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
                        G  D
  Get up and praise the Lord
