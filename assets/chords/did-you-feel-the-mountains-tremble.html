  DID YOU FEEL THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE
  ----------------------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  D
  Did you feel the mountains tremble?
  G
  Did you hear the oceans roar?

  G                        A      D   A
  Jesus Christ the risen One.
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  D
  Did you feel the people tremble?
  G
  Did you hear the singers roar?
  Em7
  When the lost began to sing of
  G                        A      D   A
  Jesus Christ the saving One.
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
             G                    D
  And we can see that God You're moving.
           G                      D
  A mighty river through the nations.
              G                    D9
  And young and old will turn to Jesus.
  Em
  Fling wide you heavenly gates,
  G                      A       D
  prepare the ways of the risen Lord.
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  D                               G
  Open up the doors and let the music play,
  Em                              D    A
  let the streets resound with singing.
  D                                          G
  Songs that bring Your hope, songs that bring Your joy, 
  Em                         D     A
  dancers who dance upon injustice.
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  D
  Do you feel the darkness tremble?
  G
  when all the saints join in one song?
  Em7
  And all the streams flow as one river,
  G                        A      D   A
  to wash away our brokenness.
