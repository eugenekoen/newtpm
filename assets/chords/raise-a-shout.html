  RAISE A SHOUT
  -------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
      D
  On a cross there hung a man
         A           D
  Who redefined who I am
           Bm                  G
  Like than man, there has been none
            A                        D
  Perfection murdered for the sake of love
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
      D
  On a cross there hung a man
                A                      D
  Who could have turned, who could have ran  
        Bm                 G
  In the garden he wept and said
               A                  D
  If it pleases you dad, my cup is death
  
  CHORUS
  ------
         G              D
  Raise a shout, for the saviour
         G              Bm
  Raise a shout, for the king
             G                Bm
  I've got to shout, for these tears
                 A             D
  Are filled with freedom, as I sing
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
      D
  On a cross there hung a man
               A                    D
  Who broke the curse, of a helpless man
            Bm               G
  If not for him, why would I rise
                A                  D
  But because of him, I'm breathing life
  
  VERSE 4
  -------
      D
  On a cross there is no man
        A                 D
  Yes he died but he rose again
          Bm               G
  Death is broken, heaven's awe
            A               D
  Will be my portion forever more
