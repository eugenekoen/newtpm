    BATTLE SONG
    -----------
  
    Intro:
    E  C#m  A  
    
    VERSE 1
    -------
    E
    As the battle rages on
    C#m
    Looking back at what You've done
    A
    I can see Your hand in this
    H
    Peace in every circumstance
    E
    Tie Your truth around my waist
    C#m
    Safe behind the shield of faith
    A
    I will put Your armour on
    A
    Lead me back to battle strong
    
    CHORUS
    ------
    E
    In the chaos You reign
    E
    In the tempest You save
    A
    In the struggle You're strong
    A
    Your praise on my tongue
    E
    I will not be afraid
    E
    For You call me by name
    A
    To Your cause I belong
    A
    You're my battle song
    
    VERSE 2
    -------
    E
    I will put Your armour on
    C#m
    I will sing a holy song
    A
    I keep Your word in front me
    E
    For You have won the victory
    
    BRIDGE
    ------
    C#m
    Even on the frontline You are with me
    A
    Even in the fire You're in control
    E
    Even though a thousand may surround me
    A
    I'm confident that You won't let me go
