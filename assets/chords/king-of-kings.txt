  BRIDGE
  ------
  	Bm		  G
  And the morning that You rose
  	A		  D
  All of heaven held it’s breath
  	   Bm		       G
  Till that stone was moved for good
  	 A		    D
  For the Lamb had conquered death

  	 Bm		      G
  And the dead rose from their tombs
  	A	        D
  And the angels stood in awe
  	Bm		   G
  For the souls of all who’d come
          A	     D
  To the Father are restored

  	 D/F#		      G
  And the Church of Christ was born
  	   A		 D
  Then the Spirit lit the flame
  	 D/F#		  G
  Now this gospel truth of old
  	   A		    D
  Shall not kneel, shall not fade
  
          D/F#		 G
  By His blood and in His name
  	     A		  D
  And in His freedom I am free
  	D/F#		G
  For the love of Jesus Christ 
  	A	    D
  Who has resurrected me
