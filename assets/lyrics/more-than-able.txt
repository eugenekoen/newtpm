  MORE THAN ABLE
  ==============
  ================================================
   
  VERSE 1
  ------- 
  When did I start to forget
  All of the great things You did
  When did I throw away faith
  for the impossible?  
  
  How did I start to believe
  You weren’t sufficient for me
  Why do I talk myself out of seeing miracles?
   
  CHORUS 1
  --------
  You are more than able
  You are more than able
  You are more than able
  You are more than able
  Who am I to deny what the Lord can do
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Now I see all that I have
  And I’ve got my confidence back
  I put my trust in the one who still does miracles
  You do miracles
   
  BRIDGE 1
  -------- 
  Can you imagine
  with all of the faith in the room
  what the Lord can do, what the Lord can do
  It’s gonna happen
  Just let the Way Maker through
  He’s gonna move, He’s gonna move
   
  Can you imagine
  with all of the faith in the room
  what the Lord can do, what the Lord can do
  It’s gonna happen
  Just let the Way Maker through
  He’s gonna move, He’s gonna move
   
  Can you imagine
  with all of the faith in the room
  what the Lord can do, what the Lord can do
  It’s gonna happen
  Just let the Way Maker through
  He’s gonna move, He’s gonna move
   
  BRIDGE 2
  --------
  Anything is possible
  Anything is possible
  Anything is possible
  Who am I to deny what the Lord can do
   
  REFRAIN
  -------
  I’ve come a long way
  I’ve seen how you work
  There’s so much goodness and grace
  Much more than I deserve
   
  I know who I am
  I can’t stay where I’m at
  We’ve come this far by faith
  And I just can’t turn back
   
  He's not done with me yet
  He's not done with me yet
  There’s so much more to the story
  You’re not done with me yet
