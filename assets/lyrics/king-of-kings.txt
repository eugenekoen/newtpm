  KING OF KINGS
  =========
  ================================================

  VERSE 1
  -------
  In the darkness we were waiting 
  Without hope without light
  Till from heaven You came running
  There was mercy in Your eyes

  To fulfill the law and prophets
  To a virgin came the Word
  From a throne of endless glory
  To a cradle in the dirt
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Praise the Father Praise the Son
  Praise the Spirit three in one
  God of glory, Majesty
  Praise forever to the King of Kings
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  To reveal the kingdom coming
  And to reconcile the lost
  To redeem the whole creation
  You did not despise the cross

  For even in Your suffering 
  You saw to the other side
  Knowing this was our salvation
  Jesus for our sake You died
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  And the morning that You rose
  All of heaven held it’s breath
  Till that stone was moved for good
  For the Lamb had conquered death

  And the dead rose from their tombs
  And the angels stood in awe
  For the souls of all who’d come
  To the Father are restored

  And the Church of Christ was born
  Then the Spirit lit the flame
  Now this gospel truth of old
  Shall not kneel, shall not fade
  
  By His blood and in His name
  And in His freedom I am free
  For the love of Jesus Christ 
  Who has resurrected me
  
  ENDING CHORUS
  -------------
  Praise the Father Praise the Son
  Praise the Spirit three in one
  God of glory,  Majesty
  Praise forever to the King of Kings
