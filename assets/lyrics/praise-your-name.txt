  G
  PRAISE YOUR NAME
  ================================================
   
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Even now, I can see darkness is fading
  Walls of fear, brick by brick will come down
  Your light will shine, lifting me out of the shadows
  Here and now, I know where my breakthrough is found
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  I'm gonna sing my way out of the valley
  I'm gonna shout my way up to the mountain
  I will take hold of the truth of Your promise
  I'm gonna praise, I'm gonna praise

  I'm gonna push through 'til every lie crumbles
  I'm gonna dance in the midst of the rain
  I'm gonna rest in the arms of the Father
  I'm gonna praise, I'm gonna praise Your name
   
  Oh-ohh-ohhh, I'm gonna prai-aise, oh-ohh, oh-ohh
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  There's a sound, welling up from within me.
  Heaven's power, calling hope to arise, oh-ohh
  So I'm standing tall, here in the strength 
  of Your victory, oh-ohh-ohh
  'Cause when You come, every wrong is made right, ohh   
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Fear and depression, shame and confusion
  You have to  bow, you have to bow
  All lesser things that demand my attention
  You have to bow, you have to bow        x2
   
  Fear and depression, shame and confusion
  You have to  bow, you have to bow
  All lesser things that demand my attention
  You have to bow, you have to bow
