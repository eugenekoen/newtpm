  PRAISE - ELEVATION WORSHIP
  ==========================

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I’ll praise in the valley
  Praise on the mountain
  I’ll praise when I’m sure
  Praise when I’m doubting
  I’ll praise when outnumbered
  Praise when surrounded
  Cause praise is the waters
  My enemies drown in
   
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  As long as I’m breathing
  I’ve got a reason to
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  Praise the Lord
  Oh my soul
  Praise the Lord
  Oh my soul
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I’ll praise when I feel it
  I’ll praise when I don’t
  I’ll praise cause I know
  You’re still in control
  My praise is a weapon
  It’s more than a sound
  My praise is the shout
  That brings Jericho down
   
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  Praise the Lord
  Oh my soul
  Praise the Lord
  Oh my soul

  I won’t be quiet
  My God is alive
  How could I keep it inside
  Praise the Lord
  Oh my soul
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  I’ll praise cause You’re sovereign
  Praise cause You reign
  Praise cause You rose and defeated the grave
  I’ll praise cause You’re faithful
  Praise cause You’re true
  Praise cause there’s nobody greater than You

  I’ll praise cause You’re sovereign
  Praise cause You reign
  Praise cause You rose and defeated the grave
  I’ll praise cause You’re faithful
  Praise cause You’re true
  Praise cause there’s nobody greater than You
