  BETTER IS ONE DAY

   VERSE 1
   -------

   How lovely is Your dwelling place
   Oh Lord, Almighty
   My soul doth long
   And even faints for You...
   For here my heart is satisfied
   Within your presence
   I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
    
   CHORUS
   ------
   Better is one day in Your courts
   Better is one day in Your house
   Better is one day in Your courts
   Than thousands elsewhere

   Better is one day in Your courts
   Better is one day in Your house
   Better is one day in Your courts
   Than thousands elsewhere
     
   BRIDGE
   ------
   My heart and flesh cry out
   For You the Living God
   Your Spirit's water to my soul
   I've tasted and I've seen
   Come once again to me
   I will draw near to you
   I will draw near to You
