   VERSE 1
   -------
   I am an instrument of exaltation
   And I was born to lift the name above all names
   You hear the melody of all creation   
   But there's a song of praise 
   that only I can bring
    
   CHORUS
   ------
   Who else is worthy?
   Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
   Who else is worthy?
   Who else is worthy?
   There is no one, only You, Jesus
    
   VERSE 2
   -------
   You are the infinite
   God of the ages
   Yet You chose to make my heart 
   Your dwelling place
   You healed my brokenness,
   Showed me Your glory
   So I have songs of thanks not 
   even angels sing

   BRIDGE
   ------
   Lamb of God, anointed one
   Who was and is and is to come
   Seated on the throne above
   Holy, holy
   Righteous One who shed His blood
   To prove to us the Father's love
   Jesus Christ, be lifted up
   Holy, holy
    
   Lamb of God, anointed one
   Who was and is and is to come
   You're seated on the throne above
   Holy, holy
   Righteous One who shed His blood
   To prove to us the Father's love
   Jesus Christ, be lifted up
