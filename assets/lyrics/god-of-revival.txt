  GOD OF REVIVAL
  ==============
  VERSE 1
  -------
  We see what you can do, Oh God of wonders
  Your power has no end.
  The things you've done before in greater measure
  You will do again.

  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Cause there's no prison wall You can't break through, no
  Mountain You can't move, all things are possible.
  There's no broken body you can't raise, no
  Soul that You can't save, all things are possible.

  CHORUS 1
  --------
  The darkest night, You can light it up, You can light it up, God of revival.
  Let hope arise, death is overcome, You've already won, God of revival.

  VERSE 2
  -------
  You rose in victory and now You're seated
  Forever on the throne.
  So why should my heart fear what You've defeated
  I will trust in You alone.

  CHORUS 2
  --------
  The darkest night, You can light it up, You can light it up, God of revival.
  Let hope arise, death is overcome, You've already won, God of revival.
  The darkest night, You can light it up, You can light it up, God of revival.
  Let hope arise, death is overcome, You've already won, God of revival.
  God of revival.

  BRIDGE
  ------
  Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
  Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
  Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
  Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
  Come awaken Your people, come awaken Your city
  Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
  Every stronghold will crumble, hear the chains hit the ground
  Oh God of revival pour it out, pour it out
