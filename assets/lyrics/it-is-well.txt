  IT IS WELL - BETHEL
  ===================
  ================================================
   
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Grander earth has quaked before
  Moved by the sound of His voice

  Seas that are shaken and stirred
  Can be calmed and broken for my regard
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  And through it all, through it all
  My eyes are on You

  And through it all, through it all
  It is well

  And through it all, through it all
  My eyes are on You
  And it is well, with me
   
  INTERLUDE
  --------- 
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Far be it from me to not believe
  Even when my eyes can't see

  And this mountain that's in front of me
  Will be thrown into the midst of sea
   
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  And through it all, through it all
  My eyes are on You

  And through it all, through it all
  It is well

  And through it all, through it all
  My eyes are on You
  And it is well, it is well
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  So let go my soul and trust in Him
  The waves and wind still know His name

  So let go my soul and trust in Him
  The waves and wind still know His name  
   
  BRIDGE 2
  -------- 
  It is well with my soul
  It is well with my soul
  It is well with my soul
  It is well, it is well with my soul
