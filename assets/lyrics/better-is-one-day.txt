  BETTER IS ONE DAY
  =================
  ================================================
    
   VERSE 1
   -------
   How lovely is Your dwelling place,
   oh Lord Almighty
   My soul longs and even faints for You
   For here my heart is satisfied,
   within Your presence
   I sing beneath the shadow of Your wings
    
   CHORUS
   ------
   Better is one day in Your courts
   Better is one day in Your house
   Better is one day in Your courts
   Than thousands elsewhere
        
   VERSE 2
   -------
   One thing I ask and I would seek,
   to see Your beauty
   To find You in the place Your glory dwells
    
   BRIDGE
   ------
   My heart and flesh cry out,
   for You the living God
   Your spirit's water to my soul
   I've tasted and I've seen,
   come once again to me
   I will draw near to You
   I will draw near to You
