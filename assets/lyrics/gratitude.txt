  
  GRATITUDE
  ==========================
  VERSE 1
  -------
  All my words fall short
  I got nothing new
  How could I express
  All my gratitude?
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I could sing these songs
  As I often do
  But every song must end
  And You never do
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  So I throw up my hands and praise You again and again
  'Cause all that I have is a
  Hallelujah   Hallelujah

  And I know it's not much but I've nothing else fit for a King
  Except for a heart singing
  Hallelujah  Hallelujah
   
  VERSE 3
  -------
  I've got one response
  I've got just one move
  With my arm stretched wide
  I will worship You   
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  So come on, my soul
  Oh, don't you get shy on me
  Lift up your song
  'Cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
  Get up and praise the Lord
