  
  HOLY FOREVER
  ============
   
  VERSE 1
  -------
  A thousand generations falling down in worship
  To sing the song of ages to the Lamb
  
  And all who've gone before us and all who will believe
  Will sing the song of ages to the Lamb
   
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Your name is the highest
  Your name is the greatest
  Your name stands above them all

  All thrones and dominions
  All powers and positions
  Your name stands above them all
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  And the angels cry: "Ho-o-ly"
  All creation cries: "Ho-o-ly"
  You are lifted high, ho-o-ly
  Holy fore - ver
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  If you've been forgiven and if you've been redeemed
  Sing the song forever to the Lamb

  If you walk in freedom and if you bear His name
  Sing the song forever to the Lamb
  We'll sing the song forever and amen
   
  CHORUS 2
  --------   
  And the angels cry: "Ho-o-ly"
  All creation cries: "Ho-o-ly"
  You are lifted high, ho-o-ly
  Holy fore - ver

  Hear your people sing: "Ho-o-ly"
  To the King of Kings: "Ho-o-ly"
  You will always be ho-o-ly
  Holy fore - ver
