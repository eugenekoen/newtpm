  THE KING IS IN THE ROOM
  =======================
  =================================================
   VERSE 1
   -------
   Come open the doors and make way
   The King is in the room, the King is in the room
   Expectant for strongholds to break
   Cause we know what You can do
   We know what You can do
   
   PRE-CHORUS
   ----------
   We're gonna see lives changed
   Souls saved, broken hearts made new
   
   CHORUS
   ------
   THE KING IS IN THE ROOM
   LORD, WE ENTHRONE YOU
   UPON OUR PRAISE
   THE KING IS IN THE ROOM

   THERE'S FREEDOM AND LIFE
   ANYWHERE YOU REIGN
   JESUS, WE BOW ONLY TO YOU
   WE'RE LAYING DOWN ALL OF OUR CROWNS

   THE KING IS IN THE ROOM
      
   VERSE 2
   -------
   Come see all the captives run free
   He's tearing down the walls
   He's tearing down the walls
   There's grave-shaking power when we sing
   The Name above them all
   Your Name above them all
      
   BRIDGE 1
   --------
   Fear has to flee, shame has to leave
   Before the King, before the King
   Chains have to break, dry bones awake
   Prepare the way,   oh
   
   BRIDGE 2
   --------
   Fear has to flee, shame has to leave
   Before the King, before the King
   Chains have to break, dry bones awake
   Prepare the way
   
   ENDING
   ------
   Prepare the way
   Prepare the way: He's in the room
   Prepare the way
   Prepare the way: He's in the room
